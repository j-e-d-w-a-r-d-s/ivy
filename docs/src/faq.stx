### Where do I put my image files?

Image files, along with any other static assets, should be stored in the site's resources directory, `res`. The content of this directory is copied to the output directory when the site is built.

As an example, assume we have a file named `photo.jpg` stored in a directory named `images` within the `res` directory, i.e.

    site/
    |-- res/
        |-- images/
            |-- photo.jpg

This file will be copied to the output directory and can be accessed in templates and node files via the url:

    \\@root/images/photo.jpg



### Does Ivy support featured images or image galleries?

Ivy has no special support for WordPress-style featured images but we can implement similar functionality simply by adding the image name as an attribute to the page header, e.g.

::: yaml

    ---
    title: Page Title
    image: photo.jpg
    ---

We can then check for the presence of a featured image in the appropriate template file:

::: django

    {% if node.image %}
        <img src="\\@root/images/{{node.image}}">
    {% endif %}

Yaml supports lists so we can implement galleries in a similar manner by adding a list of image names to the header and then iterating over the list in the template file:

::: django

    {% for image in node.gallery %}
        <img src="\\@root/images/{{image}}">
    {% endfor %}



### Why do I get an error when I add a url to a Yaml header?

Yaml doesn't support unquoted values that begin with an `@` symbol so you'll get a scary looking error message if you add a bare `\\@root/` url to a Yaml header, e.g.

    ---
    image: \\@root/images/photo.jpg
    ---

Quoting the url solves the problem:

    ---
    image: "\\@root/images/photo.jpg"
    ---

And yes, I think it's ugly too.
