title: Quickstart

Install Ivy from the Python Package Index using `pip`:

    $ pip install ivy

Note that Ivy requires Python 3.5 or later. You can check your Python version using the `--version` flag:

        $ python --version

Depending on how your system has been configured, `pip` may be hardwired to use Python 2 and you may have to explicitly specify `pip3` instead.

Once Ivy has installed, create a new directory for your site and `cd` into it:

    $ mkdir mysite
    $ cd mysite

Initialize the site directory using the `init` command:

    $ ivy init

Ivy will create the following directory structure for your site:

    mysite/
        config.py    # site configuration file
        ext/         # extensions directory for plugins
        inc/         # includes directory for menus, etc.
        lib/         # library directory for themes
        out/         # output directory for html files
        res/         # resources directory for static assets
        src/         # source directory for text files

Ivy initializes your `src` directory with a simple skeleton site which you can build immediately using the `build` command:

    $ ivy build

You can run the `build` command from the site directory itself or from any of its subdirectories. It tells Ivy to render the text files in the `src` directory into HTML and place the output in the `out` directory.

Run the `build` command and take a look at the output. You can open the HTML files directly in your browser or use Ivy's builtin web server to serve the contents of the `out` directory:

    $ ivy serve

This command will start the test server and automatically launch the default web browser to view the site. Hit Ctrl-C when you want to shut the server down.

Ivy will build the site using its default `graphite` theme, which you can find in the `lib` folder. Try rebuilding the site using the `debug` theme which is less pretty but provides a lot of useful information that can help you when building or customizing your own themes:

    $ ivy build --theme debug

You can run `ivy --help` to see a list of all the available commands. Note that you can get help for a specific command by running

    $ ivy help <command>

replacing `<command>` with the command name.
